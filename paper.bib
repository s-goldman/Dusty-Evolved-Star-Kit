  abstract = {We have developed a general purpose dust radiative transfer code for an axisymmetric system, 2-DUST, motivated by the recent increasing availability of high-resolution images of circumstellar dust shells at various wavelengths. This code solves the equation of radiative transfer following the principle of long characteristic in a two-dimensional polar grid while considering a three-dimensional radiation field at each grid point. A solution is sought through an iterative scheme in which self-consistency of the solution is achieved by requiring a global luminosity constancy throughout the shell. The dust opacities are calculated through Mie theory from the given size distribution and optical properties of the dust grains. The main focus of the code is to obtain insights on (1) the global energetics of dust grains in the shell and (2) the two-dimensional projected morphologies that are strongly dependent on the mixed effects of the axisymmetric dust distribution and inclination angle of the shell. Here test models are presented with discussion of the results. The code can be supplied with a user-defined density distribution function and, thus, is applicable to a variety of dusty astronomical objects possessing the axisymmetric geometry.},

  abstract      = {We model multi-wavelength broadband UBVIJHK$_{s}$ and Spitzer IRAC and MIPS photometry and Infrared Spectrograph spectra from the SAGE and SAGE-Spectroscopy observing programs of two oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (O-rich AGB) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using radiative transfer (RT) models of dust shells around stars. We chose a star from each of the bright and faint O-rich AGB populations found by earlier studies of the SAGE sample in order to derive a baseline set of dust properties to be used in the construction of an extensive grid of RT models of the O-rich AGB stars found in the SAGE surveys. From the bright O-rich AGB population, we chose HV 5715, and from the faint O-rich AGB population we chose SSTISAGE1C J052206.92-715017.6 (SSTSAGE052206). We found the complex indices of refraction of oxygen-deficient silicates from Ossenkopf et al. and a power law with exponential decay grain size distribution like what Kim et al. used but with {$\gamma$} of -3.5, a $_{min}$ of 0.01 {$\mu$}m, and a $_{0}$ of 0.1 {$\mu$}m to be reasonable dust properties for these models. There is a slight indication that the dust around the faint O-rich AGB may be more silica-rich than that around the bright O-rich AGB. Simple models of gas emission suggest a relatively extended gas envelope for the faint O-rich AGB star modeled, consistent with the relatively large dust shell inner radius for the same model. Our models of the data require the luminosity of SSTSAGE052206 and HV 5715 to be \~{}5100 L $_{sun}$ and \~{}36,000 L $_{sun}$, respectively. This, combined with the stellar effective temperatures of 3700 K and 3500 K, respectively, that we find best fit the optical and near-infrared data, suggests stellar masses of \~{}3 M $_{sun}$ and \~{}7 M $_{sun}$. This, in turn, suggests that HV 5715 is undergoing hot-bottom burning and that SSTSAGE052206 is not. Our models of SSTSAGE052206 and HV 5715 require dust shells of inner radius \~{}17 and \~{}52 times the stellar radius, respectively, with dust temperatures there of 900 K and 430 K, respectively, and with optical depths at 10 {$\mu$}m through the shells of 0.095 and 0.012, respectively. The models compute the dust mass-loss rates for the two stars to be 2.0 {\times} 10$^{-9}$ M$_{sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ and 2.3 {\times} 10$^{-9}$ M$_{sun}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. When a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0.002 is assumed for SSTSAGE052206 and HV 5715, the dust mass-loss rates imply total mass-loss rates of 1.0 {\times} 10$^{-6}$ M$_{sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ and 1.2 {\times} 10$^{-6}$ M$_{sun}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. These properties of the dust shells and stars, as inferred from our models of the two stars, are found to be consistent with properties observed or assumed by detailed studies of other O-rich AGB stars in the LMC and elsewhere.},

We have obtained multi-epoch follow-up observations for these candidates with the Spitzer Space Telescope and measured their infrared (IR) light curves. This has allowed us to confirm their AGB nature and investigate pulsation behavior at very low metallicity. We have obtained high-confidence pulsation periods for 88 sources in seven galaxies. We have confirmed DUSTiNGS variable star candidates with a 20\% success rate and determined the pulsation properties of 19 sources already identified as thermally pulsing AGB stars. We find that the AGB pulsation properties are similar in all galaxies surveyed here, with no discernible difference between the DUSTiNGS galaxies (down to 1.4\% solar metallicity; [Fe/H] = {\minus}1.85) and the far more metal-rich Magellanic Clouds (up to 50\% solar metallicity; [Fe/H] = {\minus}0.38). These results strengthen the link between dust production and pulsation in AGB stars and establish the IR period{\ndash}luminosity relation as a reliable tool ({\plusmn}4\%) for determining distances to galaxies, regardless of metallicity.},

Leo P is one of the best examples of a nearby analog of high-redshift galaxies because of its primitive metal content (2\% of the solar value), proximity, and isolated nature, ensuring a less complicated history. Using medium-band optical photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we have classified the AGB candidates by their chemical type. We have identified one oxygen-rich source which appears to be dusty in both the HST and Spitzer observations. Its brightness, however, suggests it may be a planetary nebula or post-AGB object. We have also identified three carbon-rich candidates, one of which may be dusty. Follow-up observations are needed to confirm the nature of these sources and to study the composition of any dust that they produce. If dust is confirmed, these stars would likely be among the most metal-poor examples of dust-producing stars known and will provide valuable insight into our understanding of dust formation at high redshift.},

The grids are calculated as a function of the stellar parameters by consistently following the growth for several dust species in their circumstellar envelopes, coupled with a stationary wind. Dust radiative transfer is computed taking as input the results of the dust growth calculations. The optical constants for amorphous carbon are selected in order to reproduce different observations in the infrared and optical bands of Gaia Data Release 2. We find a tail of extreme mass-losing carbon stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with low gas-to-dust ratios that is not present in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Typical gas-to-dust ratios are around 700 for the extreme stars, but they can be down to {\tilde}160-200 and {\tilde}100 for a few sources in the SMC and in the LMC, respectively. The total dust production rate for the carbon star population is {\tilde}1.77 {\plusmn} 0.45 {\times} 10$^{-5}$ M$_{&sun; }$yr$^{-1}$, for the LMC, and {\tilde}2.52 {\plusmn} 0.96 {\times} 10$^{-6 }$M$_{&sun;}$ yr$^{-1}$, for the SMC. The extreme carbon stars observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array and their wind speed are studied in detail. For the most dust-obscured star in this sample the estimated mass-loss rate is {\tilde}6.3 {\times} 10$^{-5}$ M$_{&sun;}$ yr$^{-1}$.
